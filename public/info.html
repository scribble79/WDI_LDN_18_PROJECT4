<h1>Information For Families</h1>

<p>Southwark Local Authority is reorganising how Children’s Centre services are to be delivered across the borough.

                            

From 1st April 2016 there will be changes to the way the Children’s Centres in Bermondsey and Rotherhithe are led and managed.

 

Pilgrims Way Primary School and Children’s Centre and Kintore Way Nursery School and Children’s Centre will be jointly leading the Children’s Centres in the Bermondsey and Rotherhithe locality. This includes Kintore Way Children’s Centre, South Bermondsey Children’s Centre, Pilgrim’s Way Children’s Centre and Rotherhithe Children’s Centre.

 

Our aim is to ensure children and their families are able to access high quality provision and support.

 

You may in the future begin to see some changes to the provision at the Children’s Centres in Bermondsey and Rotherhithe as we need to consult with families and staff how best we can respond to the needs of all families in the locality by providing services that are sustainable, consistent and effective.

In the short term we will endeavour to continue to provide the programme outlined in the Let’s Go Guide but please check with Children Centre staff for more information.
